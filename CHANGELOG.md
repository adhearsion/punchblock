  * Feature: Added a Connection for Asterisk, utilising RubyAMI to open an AMI connection to Asterisk, and allowing AMI actions to be executed. AMI events are handled by the client event handler.
  * Deprecation: The punchblock-console and the associated DSL are now deprecated and the punchblock-console gem should be used instead

# [v0.5.1](https://github.com/adhearsion/punchblock/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1)
  API change: Connections now raise a Punchblock::Connection::Connected instance as an event, rather than the class itself

# [v0.5.0](https://github.com/adhearsion/punchblock/compare/v0.4.3...v0.5.0)
  * Refactoring/API change: Client and connection level concerns are now separated, and one must create a Connection to be passed to a Client on creation. Client now has the choice between an event queue and guarded event handlers.

  * Feature: Support for meta-data on recordings (size & duration)
  * Feature: Allow specifying all of Blather's setup options (required to use PB as an XMPP component)

  * Bugfix: Conference complete event was not being handled

# [v0.4.1](https://github.com/adhearsion/punchblock/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

# v0.4.0
  * First public release
